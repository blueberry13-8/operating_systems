When we should use:
1) Deadlock Avoidness:
    We need to avoid all deadlocks, we must know all resourse requirements in advance, the number 
    of resourse's allocation must be fixed.
2) Deadlock prevention:
    We need to avoid all deadlocks, system must have strict rules about resourse managing. For instance,
        "Avoid assigning a resource unless absolutely necessary, and try to
        make sure that as few processes as possible may actually claim the
        resource."
3) Recovery:
    We don't care about ill effects(of killing the processes) or preemption losses, or we know in advance about them.
