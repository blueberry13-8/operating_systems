We can increase Hit/Miss with simple example: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
    We should have the same page for reference. Then the ratio will go to infinity(because of 0 in denominator)

Also we can decrease Hit/Miss with all different pages for reference in sequence.
    For example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ...
    Then the ratio will be 0(because of 0 in numerator)
