We can see that program execute faster with more threads.

I had 9.65 seconds with one thread(on my PC)
I had 6.12 seconds with two thread(on my PC)
I had 3.87 seconds with four thread(on my PC)
I had 2.94 seconds with ten thread(on my PC)
I had 2.36 seconds with hundred thread(on my PC)

So it's faster with more threads. But in the end we see little growth of speed.

It happened bcause of number of threads on my CPU.

Therefore, if we need the best perfomance we should find some happy medium 
between number of threads in program and number of threads in CPU.
